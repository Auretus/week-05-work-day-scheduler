# Week 05 Homework: Work Day Scheduler
## Purpose
This is meant to show that 
* I can make use of moment.js to grab time info, and
* I can update both the page display accordingly

It's also building on capabilities demonstrated in previous weeks.

## Use
Each hour block gets a place to write in appointment details. Click the save button to the right of any given slot to save the current contents of that slot to local storage. Appointment slots are colored according to their timeframe:
* sky blue : upcoming
* light green: present
* light yellow: past
Refresh to update the display colors. In the event you actually end up using this silly thing, you'll have to clear your appointments manually each morning.

Here's a screenshot.
